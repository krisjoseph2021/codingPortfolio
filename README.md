# Coding Portfolio

I am fairly new to Github and am excited to learn more about how to use this program. I have gained skills during my studies in which I have used to build a portfolio. Click on the link below to view my coding portfolio - yes, it's a Netlify link. In case you are wondering why it's a Netlify link, I am still learning if it's possible to import my coding portfolio into Github. It's a work in progress :)
